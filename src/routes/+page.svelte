            Night and evening shift workers play pivotal roles in our economy, keeping the lights on in sectors like healthcare, emergency services, public safety, logistics, and infrastructure. Yet, a gap exists in the research dedicated to understanding their transportation needs from a justice standpoint. Our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2023.103875">recent study</a> seeks to bridge this discrepancy. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Transportation Justice Important for Shift Workers?</h2>
        
        <p>
            <span class="bold">1) Safety:</span> Shift workers face higher chances of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-4575(02)00007-6">vehicle collisions</a>. Offering them alternative commuting options can potentially reduce the number of road injuries or fatalities, reinforcing public health efforts. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            <span class="bold">2) Health & Social Integration:</span> Shift work is linked with adverse <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i5210">physical</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00420-019-01434-3">mental health</a> consequences and heightened feelings of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40675-018-0114-7">social isolation</a>. Enhancing these workersâ€™ access to social and economic opportunities can help address these issues.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <span class="bold">3) Equity and Representation:</span> Global research hints at a trend where shift workers disproportionately belong to equity-deserving communities. Our study is among the first to systematically document this in Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Shifts?</h2>

        <p>
            
            The Canadian General Social Survey's <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4503">Time Use</a> wave asks whether people work day, evening, or night shifts as well as their work arrival time. We use these two data points to create a classification of shifts based on work arrival times.

            Day shifts arrive between 4am and noon

            Evening shifts arrive between noon and 7:30pm
        </p>

            </svg>   
            Night shifts arrive between 7:30pm and 4am
        </p> 


        <h2>Demographics of Shift Workers</h2>

        <p>
            We then sought out to analyze how working evening and night shifts varies among different demographic groups. 
            The General Social Survey is a relatively small sample, so we decided to use the Canadian long-form census, a 25% sample of all Canadians. We are able to identify night and evening shift workers in the 2016 Canadian Census using self-reported arrival time and the classification described above. Our findings show that slightly less than 10% of Canadians were engaged in night or evening shifts, but this varies substantially for different demographic groups.
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Overall"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">_ Income & Employment Patterns:</span> Night and evening shift workers often have lower incomes in Canada. Similar trends have been noted in the United States and the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Low-Income Status"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">_ Ethnic & Indigenous Representation:</span> Black, Filipino, South Asian, and Indigenous individuals are notably more inclined towards night and evening shifts.
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Visible Minority"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">_ Immigrant Workers:</span> Newer immigrants have a higher propensity for these shifts as well. Over time, their work patterns begin to mirror that of people born in Canada. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Immigrants"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">_ Sectors of Employment:</span> Evening workers are overrepresented in sales, services, arts, culture, manufacturing, and utilities, while night shift workers are more concentrated in vital areas like health and manufacturing or utilities. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Employment Sector"/>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p>
            Night and evening shift workers, often from equity-deserving communities, are the backbone of many essential services in Canada. 
        </p> 
        <p>    
            Now is a good time to advance these conversations, as transit agencies across North America are recognizing the value of providing <a href="https://www.governing.com/transportation/transit-agencies-rethink-schedules-for-fewer-commuters">off-peak service</a> to an off-peak ridership that has recovered faster than peak hour ridership (Brey, 2023). Further, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.08.010">research</a> suggests that many nighttime travelers make trips that could be done on foot or bicycle, if only better street lighting and pedestrian infrastructure were available (Chandra et al., 2017).
        </p> 
        <p>   
            Addressing the unique needs and challenges of shift workers and other nighttime travelers can pave the way for a more sustainable, equitable, and safe future for all.
