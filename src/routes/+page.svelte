            Night and evening shift workers play pivotal roles in our economy, keeping the lights on in sectors like healthcare, emergency services, public safety, logistics, and infrastructure. Yet, a gap exists in the research dedicated to understanding their transportation needs from a justice standpoint. Our latest <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2023.103875">study</a> seeks to bridge this discrepancy. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Transportation Justice Important for Shift Workers?</h2>
        
        <p>
            <span class="bold">1) Safety:</span> Shift workers face higher chances of vehicle accidents. Offering them alternative commuting options can potentially reduce the number of road injuries or fatalities, reinforcing public health efforts. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            <span class="bold">2) Health & Social Integration:</span> Shift work is linked with adverse physical and mental health consequences and heightened feelings of social isolation. Enhancing these workersâ€™ access to social and economic opportunities can help address these issues.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <span class="bold">3) Equity and Representation:</span> Global research hints at a trend where shift workers disproportionately belong to equity-deserving communities. Our study is among the first to systematically document this in Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Shifts?</h2>

        <p>
            Deciphering who exactly works shifts can be tricky, mainly because primary data sources, like the long-form Census, lack standard questions about workers' schedules. We overcame this limitation by cross-referencing with the Canadian General Social Survey's Time Use wave. This approach helped us categorize workers into three shifts based on their work arrival time:
        </p> 
        <p>
                <li>
                    Day (4 am - noon)
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Evening (noon - 7:30 pm)
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Night (7:30 pm - 4 am).
                </li>
        </p>


        <h2>Demographics of Shift Workers</h2>

        <p>
            Our findings suggest that fewer than 10% of Canadians were engaged in night or evening shifts at the census time. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Overall"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Income & Employment Patterns:</span> Night and evening shift workers, like their counterparts in the UK and US, often have lower incomes in Canada. This trend persists even after statistical adjustments. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Low-Income Status"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Ethnic & Indigenous Representation:</span> Black, Filipino, South Asian, and Indigenous individuals are notably more inclined towards night and evening shifts, as visualized in our data charts. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Visible Minority"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Immigrant Workers:</span> Newer immigrants have a higher propensity for these shifts. Over time, their work patterns begin to mirror that of people born in Canada. 
        </p>
        <Bar variable="Immigrants"/>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Sectors of Employment:</span> Evening workers are overrepresented in sales, services, arts, culture, manufacturing, and utilities, while night shift workers are more concentrated in vital areas like health and manufacturing or utilities. 
        </p>
